In the era where data is the new gold, organizations can have predictive advantages in the market if they have access to the right tools or to the right sources. On one hand we have machine learning and deep learning algorithms, which requires a great amount of data to get better results. On the other hand we have blockchain, which focus on the most relevant data in order to build a reliable environment.

This project combines these two cutting edge technologies. Since huge datasets are stored in data lakes, my intention is to use hyperledger fabric as a means to record only the artificial intelligence models and to control data access among organizations that are interested in these models.

<!-- The ledger would act as an access management system storing the proofs and permission by which a business can access and use the userâ€™s data. -->

## :thinking: Why Liken?

:herb: The original word, [Lichen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen), is a mutually beneficial relationship of algae or bacteria and fungi.

:deciduous_tree: Finding Lichen on the trees is a good sign that the environment is healthy and it is ok to breathe that air.

:bulb: **Liken** will provide a save environment where every organization that joins will benefit sharing their data and AI models under terms and conditions.

## Flow Chart

The following chart represents the flow of this MPV. You can check the full flow chart [here](FullSolution.md#flow-chart).

## Sequence Diagram

The following diagram represents the flow of this MPV. You can check the full sequence diagram [here](FullSolution.md#sequence-diagram).

1. Organizations are able to safely register their AI models in the ledger.
2. Organizations can also approve other organizations to update their registered models.
    - In HLF, a composite key is created to relate the model key to the organization. Also, the terms, conditions and expiration date are stored in the ledger along this composite key.
3. The allowed organizations can see and update the models, which will increase the speed of improvement of the shared models.

## :rocket: Timeline

This is the timeline implementation and future goals for this project:

1. The current code is a full blockchain-based implementation: Hyperledger Fabric, Node.js and ReactJS, which allows simple AI model sharing among organizations in the network.
2. After new refinements form this prototype, we will be able to deploy a MVP, where organizations will be able to share their AI models safely.
3. Finnaly, we want to provide integrations with datalakes and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/).
    - IPFS is a distributed file system. Adopting this approach we will reach more decentralization and reliability.
    - Having the datasets and models stored in IPFS, only the file reference will be stored in the ledger, preventing overloading.
4. As a first great goal, we want to introduce [homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption) (HE). 
    - HE will allow organizations to perform operations on encrypted private data without disclosing information, adding a new layer of security and privacy.

## :runner: How to run

This project was developed using a [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) virtual machine, so every step must be performed in a VM CLI under a _sudo -s_ command.

Start your VM and save the highlighted External IP:

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lorransutter/image/upload/v1594076924/eKYC/VM.png"/>
</p>

You must have [Fabric samples](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples) to run this project. You will clone this project inside fabric-samples folder so as to this can use the files from bin and config folders.

Here you can see the folder structure and the main files mentioned in this section:

```
ðŸ“¦fabric-samples
 â”£ ðŸ“‚bin
 â”£ ðŸ“‚config
 â”— ðŸ“‚Liken
   â”£ ðŸ“‚api
   â”£ ðŸ“‚chaincode
   â”£ ðŸ“‚frontend
      â”— ðŸ“‚src
         â”— ðŸ“‚service
            â”— ðŸ“œbaseURL.json
   â”£ ðŸ“‚test-network
   â”£ ðŸ“œ.env
   â”£ ðŸ“œnetworkDown.sh
   â”— ðŸ“œsetUp.sh
```

Open your terminal in the fabric-samples folder and clone the project.

``` sh
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/LorranSutter/Liken.git

# Go to the project folder
cd Liken
```

To run the application you will need to set your own configurations of _port_, _database_, _private key_ and _encryption key_. Create the following .env file in the indicated path and format with your customized configurations. You can use .env.sample and rename it to .env:

``` json
// ./.env

PORT_API=5000
PRIVATE_KEY="54AD766F231CCB0EA64156F1E5488"
ENCRYPTION_KEY="CoCKidLqlVuB8y1EYmKaye1UGoxtHmko1LmyqOHvVht="
MONGODB_URI_DEV="YOUR_MONGO_URI"
```

Now you will need two opened terminals to run the project. One for the API and another one for the frontend.

API will run on http://35.193.245.108:5000/

Frontend will run on http://35.193.245.108:3000/

``` sh

## In the first terminal ##

# Go to the chaincode folder
cd chaincode

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Go to the API application
cd ../api

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

``` sh
## In the second terminal ##

# Go to the frontend application
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

In order to connect frontend to the API, you will have to provide the base URL of the API in the following file:

```sh
## In the second terminal ##

# Go to the baseURL.json file
cd src/service/baseURL.json

{
    "baseURL": "http://35.193.245.108:5000"
}
```

Now you can start the network and perform all necessary set up running the following magic script:

``` sh
## In the first terminal ##

# Go to the root
cd ..

# Run the set up script
./setUp.sh
```

Run the API application:

``` sh
## In the first terminal ##

# Go to the API application
cd api

# Run API application
npm run start

# Or to use nodemon
npm run dev
```

Finally run the frontend application:

``` sh
## In the second terminal ##

# Run the project
npm start
```

If you want to stop the network and delete all artifacts created, just run the next magic script below:

``` sh
## In the first terminal ##

# Go to the root
cd ..

# Run the script
./networkDown.sh
```
